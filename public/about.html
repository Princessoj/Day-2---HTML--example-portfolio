<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have never had much to say about myself but I guess I have to give this a lot of thought. I would like to start off by saying well I am very much far from the most serious person you would ever meet amd what's wrong with having a sense of humor? I mean coding would already make you lose your mind sometimes so why let not have a sense of humor to ease off the stress once or twice in a while? I am in my 20s and currently a student in the Software Engineering department</p>

<p>I love to work and keep myself busy. It honestly doesn't have to be work but something to make sure I don't have an idle moment.I don't like stress(I mean no one does) but I love things that make me think logically and maybe that's why I found myself in the tech community(And maybe cause I want to work from home too hehe), a little bit of both I guess. I love cars(BMW to be precise) and hopefully I would have an xe, m3 or m8 sitting in my garage soon or could be all of them.</p>

<p>I am an ambivert, but my introverted side is more active than my extroverted side. I believe in hardwork but I also believe hardwork doesn't always have to include suffering. If the means arise to make life easier take it, as long as it's not getting anyone killed or cheated then there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. </p>
